# Project Reflection and Design Approac
## How do I approach designing software?
When designing software, I start by defining the core requirements and objectives of the project. My approach involves breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable components and then developing a clear architecture that addresses each component's needs. I prioritize creating reusable and modular code, which enhances maintainability and scalability. Testing and validation are crucial in my design process to ensure that the software meets the intended specifications and performs reliably.

## What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
Working on this 3D graphics project has significantly improved my skills in designing modular functions and implementing graphical transformations. I have learned to effectively use libraries like GLM for matrix operations and texture management, which has enhanced my understanding of how to structure complex visual components. Additionally, I’ve gained experience in designing a flexible camera system for navigation and perspective control, which is vital for creating immersive 3D environments.

## What design process did you follow for your project work?
For this project, I followed an iterative design process. I began with a basic setup for rendering simple 3D shapes and gradually incorporated more complex features such as texture mapping and lighting. I tested each component individually, ensuring it worked correctly before integrating it into the larger system. This approach allowed me to identify and address issues early in the development process, leading to a more polished final product.

## How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
The modular design and iterative development tactics I used can be applied to future projects by ensuring that each component is independently testable and reusable. This approach promotes code clarity and reduces the risk of introducing errors when adding new features. Additionally, employing a structured design process that incorporates testing at each stage can help manage complexity and improve the overall quality of the software.

## How do I approach developing programs?
In program development, I focus on writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code. I start by setting clear goals and requirements, then proceed to implement features incrementally. I emphasize the importance of thorough testing and debugging to ensure that the program functions correctly and meets the project’s objectives. Collaboration and code reviews are also integral to my development process, as they provide valuable feedback and enhance code quality.

## What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
While working on the 3D scene, I employed several new development strategies, including using OpenGL for rendering and managing textures with stb_image. I also implemented basic camera controls and projection switching, which required a deeper understanding of OpenGL's transformation matrices and input handling. The use of GLM for matrix operations and camera control was a new strategy that streamlined the process of manipulating the 3D scene.

## How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration played a crucial role in my development process. By continuously refining and expanding on the initial implementation, I was able to progressively add features such as textures, lighting, and advanced camera controls. This iterative approach allowed me to test and adjust each component individually, ensuring that each part of the system worked correctly before moving on to the next.

## How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?
Throughout the milestones, my approach to developing code has evolved from focusing on basic functionality to implementing more complex features and optimizations. Initially, I concentrated on getting the basic rendering working. As the project progressed, I incorporated more advanced techniques such as texture mapping, lighting, and camera controls. This evolution involved learning and applying new libraries and concepts, ultimately leading to a more sophisticated and feature-rich application.

## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science provides a foundation for problem-solving and logical thinking, which are essential for achieving a wide range of goals. It equips me with the skills to develop software solutions, analyze data, and create simulations and visualizations that can be applied across various fields. Whether pursuing a career in software development, data analysis, or another technical domain, the principles and techniques learned through computer science are invaluable.

## How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Computational graphics and visualizations enhance my ability to understand and represent complex data and systems. Learning about 3D rendering, transformations, and texture mapping provides a deeper understanding of how visual representations can be used to analyze and interpret data. These skills are applicable in fields such as data science, virtual reality, and scientific visualization, offering valuable tools for future educational pursuits.

## How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
In the professional realm, computational graphics and visualizations are crucial for developing applications in areas like game development, simulation, and interactive media. Mastering these skills allows me to create visually engaging and interactive experiences, which are increasingly in demand across various industries. The ability to implement and manage complex graphical systems can open doors to careers in software engineering, graphics programming, and beyond.
